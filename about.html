            <p>
              I consider myself a creative person. I have always liked to design
              things and create something with my hands. I have an academic
              degree in Design and Technology of Garments. Before 2018, my
              primary occupation was connected with custom textile industry. My
              knowledge and skills allowed me to manage a small business of
              handmade manufacturing.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now, when I am inspired with internet technologies, I am seriously
              considering changing careers. Since 2018, I have completed a
              series of courses in modern JavaScript. I have certificates in
              JavaScript Basics and Object Oriented Programming with JS. I have
              also completed courses in Node.js and React. Within my education,
              I also got acquainted with PostgreSQL and MongoDB, relational and
              unrelational databases. At my bootcamp practices, I also used Jira
              and Confluence management tools. I always try to be attentive to
              details and improve my coding effectiveness.
            </p>
            <p>My goal is to work as a Fullstack JavaScript Developer.</p>

            <h3>MERN Project</h3>
            <p>
              Currently, besides my part-time administrator job, I am learning
              programming skills with a social network project. This project
              includes building APIs with Node.js, UI development with React and
              Redux state tools and operating MongoDB. Within the project, I
              also learned web design using SASS, which I liked best. React is
              still difficult for me to tune and apply, but I am learning. At
              the same time, it may be surprising though, but I became more
              confident in building back-end within this project, CRUD
              operations became clearer to me and I think I am ready to try
              myself in a real web developer job.

            <h3>Dzansin SAA, Public Organization</h3>
            <h6>Administrator, part-time</h6>
            <p>
              My duties include managing contacts, organizing events,
              documentation maintenance, members support, etc. I also took part
              in the organization website development as a manager, which
              motivated me to consider changing carriers. Currently, my
              part-time job allows me to study web development and pursuit my
              future career, which I believe is connected with the internet
              technologies.

            <h3>LS Custom Handworks</h3>
            <h6>Designer/ Entrepreneur</h6>
            <p>
              I designed and manufactured custom dolls (individual items and
              collections) for boutiques and private clients. Conducting the
              business required some marketing (primarily in social media),
              managing ledgers, communicating with clients and doing the
              production itself. Such occupation allowed me to practice my
              handcraft skills, apply the design knowledge and earn for living
              while raising my child.
